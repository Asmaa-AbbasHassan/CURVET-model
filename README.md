## CURVETE: Curriculum Learning and Progressive Self-supervised Training for Medical Image Classification

### Datasets Used
CURVETE has been evaluated on three distinct medical image datasets:
1. **Brain Tumor Dataset**: A collection of brain MRI images used for classifying tumor types.
2. **Digital Knee X-ray Dataset**: Used to classify different knee conditions based on X-ray images.
3. **Mini-DDSM Dataset**: A mammography dataset used for breast cancer detection.
